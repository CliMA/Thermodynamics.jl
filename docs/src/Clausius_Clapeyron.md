# Clausius-Clapeyron Relation Validation

## Overview

This document validates the analytical derivatives of the Clausius-Clapeyron relation by comparing them with finite difference derivatives computed using ForwardDiff.jl. The Clausius-Clapeyron relation describes how the saturation vapor pressure changes with temperature during phase transitions.

## Purpose

The validation ensures that our analytical implementation of the Clausius-Clapeyron derivatives is mathematically correct and numerically accurate. This is critical for:

- **Saturation adjustment algorithms** that rely on accurate derivatives
- **Numerical stability** in thermodynamic calculations
- **Physical consistency** of the thermodynamic formulation

## Implementation

The validation compares two approaches:

1. **Analytical derivatives**: Direct computation using the derived mathematical expressions
2. **Finite difference derivatives**: Numerical approximation using ForwardDiff.jl

```@example
include("Clausius_Clapeyron.jl")
```

## Results

The plot shows:

- **Top panel**: Comparison of analytical vs. finite difference derivatives
- **Middle panel**: Error between the two methods
- **Bottom panel**: Saturation vapor pressure as a function of temperature

## Interpretation

- **Agreement**: The analytical and finite difference derivatives should closely match
- **Error analysis**: The middle panel shows the difference between methods
- **Physical range**: The temperature range covers typical atmospheric conditions
- **Validation**: Small errors indicate correct implementation

!!! warning "Implementation Note"
    This script is currently decoupled from the test suite implementation.
    Consider unifying the validation code with the test suite to ensure
    that tests and plots remain synchronized.

## Mathematical Background

The Clausius-Clapeyron relation describes the temperature dependence of saturation vapor pressure:

$$\frac{dp_{v,sat}}{dT} = \frac{L_v p_{v,sat}}{R_v T^2}$$

where $p_{v,sat}$ is the saturation vapor pressure, $L_v$ is the latent heat of vaporization, $R_v$ is the specific gas constant for water vapor, and $T$ is the temperature.

This relation is fundamental to understanding phase transitions in atmospheric thermodynamics.
